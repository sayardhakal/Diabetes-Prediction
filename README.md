# Diabetes-Prediction
In this project, we are building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction. I have used PIMA diabetes dataset where 9 columns are there. Among them 1 column is a target column "Outcome". The distribution of target column is as 1 and 0 (1 --> diabetes and 0 --> Non diabetes). The steps done in this project are as follow:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Train test split
4. Support vector classifier
5. Trained SVM classifier
6. Evaluation and Prediction.
